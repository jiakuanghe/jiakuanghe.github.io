# What is Debugger?

A **debugger** or **debugging tool** is a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) used to [test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing) and [debug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging) other programs (the "target" program).



## Why is debugging called debugging?

The terms "bug" and "debugging" are **popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s**. While she was working on a Mark II computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were "debugging" the system.
